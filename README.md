# I've joined the #100DaysOfJapanese Challenge

# Rules

1. **Study for at least 1 hour every day for the next 100 days**
2. Share useful resources, hacks, personal setup

# Day 0
Before you start the challenge, I recommend setting goals, i.e. what do you want to accomplish by the end of the challenge? Be as specific as you can
